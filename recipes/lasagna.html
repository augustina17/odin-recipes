        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1, 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1, 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>   
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Direction</strong></h4>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. <br> 
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, <br>
        Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, <br>
        stirring occasionally.</p>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
        Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, <br>
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise <br>
         over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
         Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with <br>
         remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, <br>
         or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.    </p>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
