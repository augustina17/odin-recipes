    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 thick slices bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>How to Make French Toast</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak It</strong></li>
        <p>Chef John whips up a simple egg and milk custard flavored with cinnamon and <br>
            vanilla, then lets thick slices of day-old bread soak in it until each slice is thoroughly saturated.</p>
        <li><strong>Fry It</strong></li>
        <p>Three minutes per side in hot butter seals the custardy coating onto the bread and <br>
            gives it that eye-popping golden brown crust.</p>
        <li><strong>Bake It</strong></li>
        <p>This is the step you didn't see coming. Chef John lays the French toast on a baking sheet, and <br>
            bakes it in a 400° F oven for 12 to 15 minutes. The heat causes the custard-soaked toast to puff up <br>
            beautifully while it finishes cooking on the inside.</p>
